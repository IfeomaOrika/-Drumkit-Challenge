# Drumkit-Challenge

**Live Site**

**My process** 

I designed the page with html and css.

JavaScript was used to add functionality to the drum buttons.

Using the **querySelector** element, I selected all the elements with the class of drums.

I used a for loop to loop through the total number of drums buttons. 

Inside the for loop, I searched through the document to select all of the drum buttons. And added an event listener of “click”. 

I added a makeSound and button Animation methods to add sound to each button once the corresponding key is pressd and animate the buttons when clicked.

I used the switch case statement so that when a key is clicked, it plays the corresponding sound.

I used the buttonAnimation function to add and remove the button click after a duration of 100 milliseconds.

**My stack for the project**  

HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript           

**What I learned**

This project helped me understand the Document Object Model better. When I watched the tutorial, I had some difficulty understanding what the DOM was all about. But when I got my hands dirty and actually put in the work with this project, I began to understand the concept better.

**This Statement**

I learnt more about the **this** statement in JavaScript. 

Every function has a **this** reference automatically created when you declare it.

The **this** keyword can be used in the global and function contexts.

“**This**” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. It references the object that is executing the current function. 

If the function being referenced is a regular function, “this” references the global object. 

If the function that is being referenced is a method in an object, “this” references the object itself.

**Switch case**

I learned about the switch case statement. It is an alternative to the **if else** statement in some cases. It must always have a break at the end of each statement.

The switch expression is evaluated once. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed. 

If there is no match, the default code block is executed. When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.

However, If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.

**What I realized I need to improve on**.

My knowledge of JavaScript jQuery.  Manipulation of the DOM with vanilla JS required some extra work. 

jQuery takes care of this. In subsequent projects I will implement JQuery for optimum performance.

Continued development  This is one of the various projects I plan to do with JS to improve my knowledge. Doing subsequent projects should expand my knowledge of JavaScript.
